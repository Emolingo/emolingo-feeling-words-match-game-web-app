This game is intended for expanding vocabulary of emotion-describing terms.

The game works by taking 3 random pairs of matching emotion-describing terms,
and then shuffling the corresponding 6 terms and displaying them to the user.
The user then has to match the 3 pairs by clicking on each term and then on its
corresponding peer.

This is the main development branch.
